# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Live Chat Memory feature enhances the existing live chat functionality by providing Pico with persistent memory capabilities through function calling. This allows Pico to remember details about the child, their conversations, life events, and personal information across chat sessions, creating a more personalized and engaging experience. The feature uses Google's Gemini Live API with asynchronous function calling to store and retrieve memories without blocking the conversation flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Memory Storage Function Calling

**User Story:** As Pico, I want to store important information about the child during our conversations so that I can remember details about them in future interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Pico learns something important about the child THEN the system SHALL provide a `write_to_memory` function that allows storing key-value pairs to local storage
2. WHEN storing a memory THEN the function SHALL accept a key (string) and value (string) parameter and persist the data locally
3. WHEN the `write_to_memory` function is called THEN it SHALL use asynchronous function calling with NON_BLOCKING behavior to avoid interrupting the conversation
4. WHEN a memory is successfully stored THEN the function SHALL return a confirmation response
5. WHEN storing fails THEN the function SHALL return an error response with details about the failure

### Requirement 2: Memory Retrieval Function Calling

**User Story:** As Pico, I want to access all stored memories about the child so that I can reference previous conversations and personal details naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Pico needs to recall information about the child THEN the system SHALL provide a `read_all_memories` function that retrieves all stored key-value pairs
2. WHEN retrieving memories THEN the function SHALL return all stored memories as a structured object or array
3. WHEN the `read_all_memories` function is called THEN it SHALL use asynchronous function calling with NON_BLOCKING behavior
4. WHEN memories are successfully retrieved THEN the function SHALL return the complete memory dataset
5. WHEN no memories exist THEN the function SHALL return an empty dataset without errors

### Requirement 3: System Prompt Integration for Memory Usage

**User Story:** As a child, I want Pico to remember things about me and bring them up naturally in conversation so that our relationship feels more personal and meaningful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the live chat session starts THEN the system prompt SHALL instruct Pico to actively use memory functions to remember important details about the child
2. WHEN the child shares personal information THEN the system prompt SHALL encourage Pico to store relevant details using the `write_to_memory` function
3. WHEN starting a conversation THEN the system prompt SHALL instruct Pico to retrieve existing memories using `read_all_memories` and reference them naturally
4. WHEN using stored memories THEN the system prompt SHALL guide Pico to bring up relevant details contextually rather than mechanically listing them
5. WHEN the child mentions something previously discussed THEN the system prompt SHALL encourage Pico to demonstrate remembering by referencing stored information

### Requirement 4: Gemini Live API Function Declaration Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the memory functions to be properly configured in the Gemini Live API session so that Pico can use them seamlessly during conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the live chat session THEN the system SHALL define `write_to_memory` and `read_all_memories` as function declarations in the tools configuration
2. WHEN defining the `write_to_memory` function THEN it SHALL specify parameters for key (string) and value (string) with appropriate descriptions
3. WHEN defining the `read_all_memories` function THEN it SHALL specify no parameters and describe its purpose of retrieving all stored memories
4. WHEN configuring function behavior THEN both functions SHALL use `Behavior.NON_BLOCKING` to allow asynchronous execution
5. WHEN handling function responses THEN the system SHALL use appropriate scheduling (INTERRUPT, WHEN_IDLE, or SILENT) based on the context

### Requirement 5: Local Storage Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want my child's conversation memories to be stored locally on our device so that their personal information remains private and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing memory storage THEN the system SHALL use browser localStorage API for persistence
2. WHEN storing memories THEN each key-value pair SHALL be saved with a unique identifier to avoid conflicts
3. WHEN retrieving memories THEN the system SHALL handle cases where localStorage is unavailable or disabled
4. WHEN the storage quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and inform the user
5. WHEN clearing browser data THEN stored memories SHALL be removed, and the system SHALL handle this scenario without errors

### Requirement 6: Memory Content Guidelines

**User Story:** As a parent, I want the system to store appropriate information about my child while respecting privacy and focusing on positive relationship building.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing memories THEN the system SHALL focus on positive details like interests, achievements, favorite activities, and meaningful experiences
2. WHEN a child shares personal information THEN Pico SHALL store relevant details that enhance future conversations (name, age, pets, hobbies, family members)
3. WHEN storing emotional information THEN the system SHALL focus on positive coping strategies and growth rather than dwelling on negative experiences
4. WHEN handling sensitive topics THEN the system SHALL store supportive context rather than detailed personal problems
5. WHEN memories accumulate THEN the system SHALL prioritize recent and frequently referenced information

### Requirement 7: Function Response Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle function responses properly so that memory operations work reliably without disrupting the conversation flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function call is made THEN the client SHALL handle the response using the session.sendToolResponse method
2. WHEN processing `write_to_memory` responses THEN the system SHALL confirm successful storage and handle any errors appropriately
3. WHEN processing `read_all_memories` responses THEN the system SHALL make the retrieved data available to Pico for use in conversation
4. WHEN function calls fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue the conversation without breaking the user experience
5. WHEN multiple function calls are made THEN the system SHALL handle them asynchronously without blocking conversation flow

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Chat Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the memory functionality to integrate seamlessly with the existing live chat system so that implementation is efficient and user experience is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing memory functions THEN they SHALL integrate with the existing RealtimeExpressBuddyAvatar and Google Live Speech system
2. WHEN adding function calling THEN it SHALL work alongside existing conversation features without conflicts
3. WHEN storing memories THEN it SHALL not interfere with existing session management or XP tracking systems
4. WHEN retrieving memories THEN it SHALL enhance rather than replace existing conversation capabilities
5. WHEN deploying the feature THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing chat functionality

# 🚀 Quick Netlify Update - CRITICAL

## ⚠️ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Your Netlify build is failing because of peer dependency conflicts with Vite 7.

### ✅ SOLUTION: Update Your Netlify Build Command

**Go to Netlify Dashboard:**
1. Site Settings → Build & deploy → Continuous deployment
2. Click "Edit settings" on Build settings
3. Change "Build command" to:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build
```

4. Keep "Publish directory" as: `build`
5. Save changes
6. Trigger a new deploy

---

### That's it! 🎉

After this change:
- ✅ Build will succeed
- ✅ Build time: ~7-10 seconds (down from 25+ seconds)
- ✅ All features will work as before

### Alternative: Use netlify.toml

If you prefer configuration file, create `netlify.toml` in project root:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build"
  publish = "build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "22.18.0"
```

Then commit and push this file.
